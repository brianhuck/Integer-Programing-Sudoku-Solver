# Integer-Programing-Sudoku-Solver
Model the sudoku puzzle as an Integer Program using google's ortools package in Python


My goal of creating the Sudoku Solver was to learn how to use subscripts and for-all statements in the ortools package when modelining integer programs.  A bonus feature that I learned was how to reference simple tables which is common in solver software.
